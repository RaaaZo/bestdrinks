## BestDrinks Page

Page with recipes for drinks. After sign in You can add, update and delete Your recipes. Without sign in You can take a look at the added recipes. Front-end is written in React (used Context instead of Redux, formik for forms, and other React libraries), Backend in Express.js, and I used MongoDB as a database.
